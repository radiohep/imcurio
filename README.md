# imcurio
Playground for toy models of intensity mapping observations.

## Scope

This is a simple simulator of intensity mapping observations that simulate a fixed set of visibilities for a fixed telescope and fixed sky, but the signals are otherwise reasonably realistic. It relies on Hidden Valley simulations from the Berkeley groyp

## Instructions

Download sims by running `bin/download_sims.sh`. Then look at the notebooks in the `notebook` directory.
